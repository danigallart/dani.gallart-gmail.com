# CoVid-19 distribution

This is a simple Python code evaluating the distribution of CoVid-19 for two different models, one based on probability theory and the other one based on the spreading factor of the virus. It also models the confinement effects on the spreading power of the virus.

## What does it compute?

- **Infected** - Computes the number of infected population.
- **Non-infected** - Computes the number of non-infected population.
- **Immune** - Computes the number of immune population.
- **Deths** - Computes the number of deaths.

## Comparison with real data
It is possible to compare with real data from worldometer.
